This set contains 1552 images of size 448x448 pixels.
The augmenters applied to the original images are:
   -Flip vertically (100% of the original images)
   -Flip horizontally (100% of the original images)
   -MultiplySaturation between 1,4 and 1,5 and GammaContrast between 1,7 and 1,9 (35% of the training set)
   -AdditiveLaplaceNoise of (0,06*255) (45% of the training set)
   -AdditiveLaplaceNoise of (0,12*255) (20% of the training set)
   -MultiplySaturation between 1,4 and 1,5 and GammaContrast between 1,7 and 1,9 (100% of the test and validation set)
This dataset contains a python file to Scan(), Increment(int) or Replicate() a dataset and a json registry file to keep track of the current file configuration for active learning.
	Scan will create the json file with the description of the img and label addresses and if they have been moved or not yet
	Increment will move the given amount of percentage of images (of the total training set) to the training folder
	Replicate() will replicate the location of the images according to the json file. Useful when recovering a previous state but all images are back in the activeLearning folder
